                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (1931–2015), known as the "Missile Man of India," was an eminent Indian scientist and the 11th President of India (2002–2007). Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he played a key role in India's civilian space program and military missile development, particularly in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests of 1998.

                    He worked with organizations like DRDO and ISRO and was instrumental in developing the Agni and Prithvi missiles. Despite his scientific achievements, Kalam was also deeply committed to education, youth empowerment, and nation-building. Known for his humility and inspirational speeches, he authored several books, including Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds.
                    
                    Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture, continuing his mission of inspiring youth till his last breath. He remains a beloved figure in India for his vision, integrity, and dedication.</p>
